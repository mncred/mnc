Prepare current directory for use with mnc
It will create mnc.yml in the root of the current dir.

The mnc.yml file is required to store info about managed assets (mods, plugins, shaders, etc.).
The mnc.yml is similar to package.json or go.mod file with all set of dependencies of the current project.
